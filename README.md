# Multi-Agent Face Recognition and Video Processing System

## Overview
This project is a Multi-Agent System developed using CrewAI for face recognition and video processing. The system is designed to enable automated and intelligent media analysis through specialized agents.

### Features
- **Face Recognition Agent**: Identifies and matches faces in images and videos, useful for security systems, photo organization, and identity verification.
- **Video Processing Agent**: Automates video editing, including highlight creation, scene trimming, and video compilation based on user specifications.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction and visualization.
